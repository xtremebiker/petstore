========

This project tries to cover the main functions of JSF 2 specification. Used fields are:

<ul>

<li>Managed beans, in their different scopes (@ApplicationScoped, @SessionScoped, @ViewScoped, @RequestScoped)</li>

<li>Navigation from view-to-view in JSF</li>

<li>The use of the EL language in its 2.2 version</li>

<li>A variety of JSF 2 components</li>

<li>Composite components and templating</li>

<li>Messaging in JSF</li>

<li>Faces Validators</li>

<li>Some new features of JSF 2.2 shown</li>

</ul>



<h4>Requirements</h4>
*The project has been tested on Tomcat 7, even it should be compatible with every Servlet 3.0 container. If using it with an Application Server as GlassFish or JBoss AS, take care to configure the bundled JSF packages properly because it's expected to work with JSF 2.2 implementations.*

*Maven is required to package the application, just use mvn install over it.*
